The Dataset package handles two main functionalities:

    1) Collection, validation, and formatting of data:
        > Scrape user info from web
        > Select users and download their game info until dataset criteria are met
        > Compute additional info from downloaded files
    2) Data loading for machine learning:
        > Load data and convert to correct format for ML architecture
